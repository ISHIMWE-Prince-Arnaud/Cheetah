                    <p>
                              Cheetahs are unique members of the big cat family, distinguished by their physical 
                              adaptations, hunting strategies, and ecological roles. Below is a detailed explanation of 
                              how cheetahs compare and contrast with other big cats like lions, tigers, leopards, and 
                              jaguars:

                                                  Cheetahs: Slim, lightweight body with long legs and a small head. Their
                                                  golden-yellow coat is covered in solid black spots, with distinctive

                                                  Tigers are powerfully built for strength and stealth.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                                  Cheetahs: The fastest land animal, capable of reaching speeds of up to 
                                                  70 mph (112 km/h). They rely on speed and sight for hunting, targeting 
                                                  small to medium prey like gazelles. Hunts are typically conducted in 
                                                  short, explosive chases during the day.

                                                  large prey like zebras and buffalo.

                                                  Tigers: Solitary hunters that rely on stealth, ambushing large prey such
                                                   as deer and wild boar
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                  Leopards and Jaguars: Stealthy ambush predators. Leopards are agile 
                                                  climbers and stash prey in trees, while jaguars often hunt near water,
