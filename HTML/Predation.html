                    <h1>Cheetah as a Predator: The Ultimate Speed Hunter</h1>
                    <p>
                              The cheetah is a specialized predator that relies on speed, agility, and precision to hunt 
                              prey. Unlike other large predators that rely on strength or stealth over extended periods, 
                              the cheetah's hunting strategy is short, explosive, and meticulously calculated. Below is a 
                              detailed breakdown of the cheetah's predatory prowess:
                    </p>

                    <h2>Physical Adaptations for Hunting</h2>
                    <p>Cheetahs are uniquely built for their role as sprint hunters. Every aspect of their physiology 
                              supports their ability to chase and capture prey quickly and efficiently
                    </p>

                    <h3>a. Speed and Agility</h3>
                    <p>
                              Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds of 70 mph (112 km/h). 
                              However, they can maintain these speeds for only 20–30 seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                              They accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 3 seconds, faster than most sports cars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                              Their flexible spine acts like a spring, enabling long strides of up to 21 feet (6.4 meters) per leap.
                    </p>

                    <h3>b. Claws and Paws</h3>
                    <p>Unlike most cats, cheetahs have semi-retractable claws that provide traction, much like the spikes on a sprinter’s shoes.</p>
                    <p>Their large pads on their paws act like tire treads, giving them a better grip during high-speed chases.</p>

                    <h3>c. Tail for Balance</h3>
                    <p>The long, muscular tail serves as a rudder, helping the cheetah make sharp turns while pursuing agile prey. It counterbalances their body weight during rapid directional changes.</p>

                    <h3>d. Enhanced Senses</h3>
                    <p>Eyesight: Cheetahs rely on exceptional daytime vision rather than scent. Their eyes are specially adapted to spot prey from long distances and focus on it during the chase.</p>
                    <p>Tear Marks: The distinctive black lines under their eyes reduce glare from the sun and improve focus, particularly in open, sunlit landscapes.</p>

                    <h3>e. Respiratory and Cardiovascular System</h3>
                    <p>During a chase, a cheetah's heart rate can soar to 150 bpm or more, and its large nasal passages and lungs ensure oxygen intake keeps pace with its speed.</p>
                    <p>Their body is designed to dissipate heat quickly, but chases must remain short to avoid overheating.</p>

                    <h2>Hunting Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Cheetahs have a unique hunting approach that minimizes effort while maximizing success.</p>
                    <h3>a. Stalking Phase</h3>
                    <p>Cheetahs rely on stealth to approach their prey as closely as possible, typically within 100–200 feet (30–60 meters).</p>
                    <p>They use the tall grass and their spotted coat for camouflage, blending seamlessly into the environment.</p>
                    <h3>b. Chase Phase</h3>
                    <p>Once within range, the cheetah explodes into a high-speed sprint, targeting a specific animal in the herd.</p>
                    <p>They rely on their agility to outmaneuver prey that tries to zigzag or evade capture.</p>
                    <p>The chase rarely lasts more than 30 seconds and covers distances of 200–300 meters on average.</p>
                    <h3>c. Capture</h3>
                    <p>The cheetah uses its strong forelimbs to swipe at the prey’s legs, tripping it.</p>
                    <p>Once the prey is down, the cheetah delivers a suffocating bite to the throat to kill it swiftly.</p>
                    <div>
                              <img src="../IMAGES/Hunting behaviour.png" alt="Cheetah' hunting behaviour">

                    </div>

                    <h1>Preferred Prey</h1>
                    <p>Cheetahs primarily hunt small to medium-sized herbivores. Their diet depends on the availability of prey within their habitat.</p>
                    <h3>Common Prey:</h3>
                    <p>Gazelles (e.g., Thomson’s gazelle)</p>
                    <p>Impala</p>
                    <p>Springbok</p>
                    <p>Hares</p>
                    <p>Young wildebeest or zebras (in rare cases)</p>

                    <h3>Hunting Preferences:</h3>
                    <p>Cheetahs often target young, weak, or isolated individuals in a herd.</p>
                    <p>They avoid large or aggressive animals like adult wildebeest or zebras, which can injure or kill them.</p>
                    <div>
                              <img src="../IMAGES/Wildbeast.jpg" alt="Cheetah predating wildebeest">
                              <img src="../IMAGES/Wildbeast1.jpg" alt="Cheetah predating wildebeest">
                    </div>

                    <h2>Hunting Success Rate</h2>
                    <p>Cheetahs are relatively successful hunters compared to other predators. Their success rate is about 40–50%, higher than lions or leopards. However, they face significant challenges post-hunt.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges as a Predator</h2>
                    <p>While cheetahs excel in hunting, they have several vulnerabilities:</p>
                    <h3>a. Competition from Other Predators</h3>
                    <p>Cheetahs are not built for strength or defense, making them vulnerable to larger predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas.</p>
                    <p>Their kills are often stolen, with up to 50% of their prey lost to scavengers.</p>
                    <h3>b. Physical Limitations</h3>
                    <p>After a high-speed chase, cheetahs are exhausted and need time to recover, making them temporarily vulnerable.</p>
                    <p>Overheating is a risk if the chase lasts too long, and failure to catch prey can lead to energy depletion.</p>
                    <h3>c. Habitat Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Loss of open grasslands due to human activity restricts their ability to hunt effectively.</p>

                    <h1>Hunting Style Compared to Other Predators</h1>
                    <p>Cheetahs differ significantly from other big cats in their predatory approach:</p>
                    <p>Lions: Use strength and group tactics to overpower prey.</p>
                    <p>Leopards: Ambush hunters that rely on stealth and strength.</p>
                    <p>Cheetahs: Sprint hunters, relying purely on speed and precision.</p>
